# Speedy-Shapes

You know how you never wanted to be stuck in a loop avoiding shapes flying at you in high-speed, well too bad! Introducing Speedy Shapes, you will play as Cringy the Cube making his way through the obstacle course that he can't seem to stop waking up in. Cringy must go through both levels to return back to his own reality and break the cycle once and for all.

6. Make the cube rotate 90 deg on jumps

## Potential Roadblocks

- making sure the face square I put on the cube matches the hit box correctly
- setting up the levels to scroll at a speed that is fast enough to make jumps but not too fast you just go past platforms
- making the second level load after hitting the portal
- how to time what blocks spawning when
